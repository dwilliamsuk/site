  <h2>Beginnings</h2>
  <p>Hello! You've come across the very first blog post to this site. This was created to help me work out what kind of layout I'd like for the site.</p>
  
  <h2>Plans</h2>
  <p>I plan to have the most recent blog posts on the main page. These will be completely text only and will have versions with images available if applicable. Once I deem that the main page has enough blog posts, future posts will begin to replace the older posts. These older posts will then be placed under /blog like this post.</p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>I've been wanting a blog for a while and thought it'd be worth using this domain for something. I like the idea of having a really basic simple blog that can be viewed on anything with any internet connection. It's also extremely easy to create a site with such basic HTML.</p>
